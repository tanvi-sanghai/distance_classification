#### 1. What are the common distance metrics used in distance-based classification algorithms?
##### There are multiple common distance metrics used in distance-based classification algorithms, including Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Minkowski distance. Others like Mahalanobis, Cosine, and Hamming distances are also used.

#### 2. What are some real-world applications of distance-based classification algorithms?
##### Real-world applications of distance-based classification algorithms include face recognition, spam filtering, customer behavior prediction, anomaly detection, speech recognition, medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, recommendation systems, document classification, and credit scoring. These applications rely on distance metrics to group similar objects and make accurate predictions.

#### 3. Explain various distance metrics.
##### Distance metrics are essential in classification algorithms for measuring similarity. Euclidean distance calculates the straight-line distance, while Manhattan distance measures grid-like paths. Chebyshev distance determines the maximum step between points, and Minkowski distance generalizes multiple metrics. Mahalanobis distance accounts for correlations in data, whereas Cosine distance measures vector orientation, making it useful in text classification. Hamming distance counts differing positions in binary data, aiding error detection. Each metric is suited to specific applications depending on data characteristics and classification needs.

#### 4. What is the role of cross-validation in model performance?
##### Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating model performance by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets. It helps prevent overfitting, improves model selection, and provides a reliable performance estimate. Common methods include k-fold cross-validation, which splits data into k parts for training and validation, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), where each data point is tested individually, and stratified k-fold cross-validation, which preserves class distributions for better accuracy.

#### 5. Explain variance and bias in terms of KNN?
##### In KNN, bias refers to the error from oversimplifying patterns, which increases with a high k value, leading to underfitting. Variance measures sensitivity to training data fluctuations, rising with a low k value, causing overfitting. The bias-variance tradeoff is crucial, as low k results in high variance, while high k leads to high bias. Choosing an optimal k balances both, ensuring better generalization and model performance.
